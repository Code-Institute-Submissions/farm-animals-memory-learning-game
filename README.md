 * the card colour will contrast against this background, the colour will be grey with a black border
 * the text colour will contrast against the grey and will be black

### Font Styles

The font will be simple and easy to read due to the user being a child looking to learn the animals names, so, the font will be in Open sans

### Image styles

* the Images will be cartoons due to the simplicity and universal understanding cartoons achieve.

Javascript: i have had issues with javascript from the start, after only starting to learn Javascrpt coding 2 months ago i have continuously struggled with very little help from mentors and tutors that i have frequently reached out to, they have provided very little help with helping me understand how to code javascript and understand what each part does and how it all ineracts together. what i have put together is my best effort at making a cards flip over revealing the front cards, i am aware that the code does not work, however, im unsure how to fix this issue and have gone to tutors multiple times asking for help on how i should go about fixing this issue and have been provided with nothing to aid me.

## issues

As previously stated in the javascript part, i have constantly been strugling to understand javascript and have had very little success in understanding how the code works and how i can learn to impliment it, what i have produced is my best effort at making what i have been asked to make, if i was given more time in understanding and leanrning this code i have no doubt that i wouldve understood and learnt how to use javascript, however 2 months is not sufficent enough time to comprehend such complex topics and concepts, 3 weeks before before writing this project into gitpod, i wrote out the project in atom to try and make sense of it all and came up equally as short with solutions. i have tried night and day at least 7 hours per day to understand the basic concepts of javascript and at this point im still extremely unsure of how things work. i have reached out to tutors, friends, family and my mentor, all have been unsucessful in helping me. as stateed above, i find 2 months to go from 0 understanding of javascript and its concepts to coding a fully functioning game absolutely ridiculous and can only be designed to set me up to fail. i am sorry that my code does not work, but i have tried my best.
